9-1: Restaurant
---

Make a class called `Restaurant`. The `__init__()` method for `Restaurant` should store two attributes: a `restaurant_name` and a `cuisine_type`. Make a method called `describe_restaurant()` that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called `open_restaurant()` that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called `restaurant` from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = self.name + " serves wonderful " + self.cuisine_type + "."
        print("\n" + msg)

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = self.name + " is open. Come on in!"
        print("\n" + msg)

restaurant = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
print(restaurant.name)
print(restaurant.cuisine_type)

restaurant.describe_restaurant()
restaurant.open_restaurant()
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen
pizza

The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

The Mean Queen is open. Come on in!
```
