Updates
===

Some of the libraries featured in the book have been updated recently, which is a good thing - it means you're learning to use Python packages that are steadily being improved. When packages are updated you have the option of using the version that was featured in the book, which lets you run code exactly as it's written in the book. You can also choose to install the latest version of each package, and modify the code in the book slightly. Each approach is outlined clearly in these updates.

Pygal has been updated to version 2. All of the code in Chapter 15 will run exactly as it's written. When you get to Chapter 16, the changes in Pygal will affect some of the code. You can read about [installing Pygal](chapter_15/README.md#installing-pygal) now, or you can wait until you get to Chapter 16.

Pygal's world map and internationalization features have been moved to a separate module. See the section on [installing Pygal](chapter_15/README.md#installing-pygal), and then see the specific updates for [Chapter 16](chapter_16/README.md).
