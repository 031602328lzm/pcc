Write a function called `display_message()` that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter. Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

```python
def display_message():
    """Display a message about what I'm learning."""
    msg = "I'm learning to store code in functions."
    print(msg)

display_message()
```

Output:
