title: Updates

Some of the libraries featured in the book have been updated recently, which is a good thing - it means you're learning to use Python packages that are steadily being improved. When packages are updated you have the option of using the version that was featured in the book, which lets you run code exactly as it's written in the book. You can also choose to install the latest version of each package, and modify the code in the book slightly. Each approach is outlined clearly in these updates.

Pygal has been updated to version 2. You can install a version of Pygal that runs the code exactly as it's written in the book, or you can install the latest version of Pygal and modify what's in the book slightly. See [installing Pygal](chapter_15/README.html#installing-pygal).

[Chapter 16](chapter_16/README.html)

Pygal's world map and internationalization features have been moved to a separate module. See the section on [installing Pygal](chapter_15/README.html#installing-pygal), and see the specific [updates for Chapter 16](chapter_16/README.html#updates).

The second half of the chapter focuses on a chart representing the most popular Python projects on GitHub. One of the projects that appears on the chart currently has been removed, but still appears in the results. This causes an error, but there's a [simple fix](chapter_17/README.html). Also, the font size settings have been moved from `config` to `style`.

[Chapter 20](chapter_20/README.html)

The process of deploying a Django project to Heroku has changed slightly. The build process runs from a temporary directory, so the `if` statement in *settings.py* needs to check for this directory as well. Also, there's an improved way of managing static files that you might want to use. See the [updates for Chapter 20](chapter_20/README.html).
